Servers and NAS devices are the backbone of any business operation. When they fail, everything stops — and the financial impact multiplies with every hour of downtime. The situation becomes even more critical when a RAID rebuild fails or multiple disks within the array go down simultaneously.

At **Dr. Hard Disk**, we respect the urgency and sensitivity of enterprise data. We have the advanced capability to reverse-engineer RAID arrays of all types and recover databases (SQL, ERPs), shared folders, and critical business files.

## What Causes RAID System Failures?

Although RAID technology (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) was designed for redundancy and protection, it can still collapse due to:

- **Multiple Disk Failures:** Many RAID levels (such as RAID 5) can tolerate a single disk failure, but if two disks fail in sequence — or a second disk fails during a rebuild — the entire array collapses.
- **RAID Controller Failure:** When the controller stops functioning, the system loses the ability to interpret how data is distributed across the drives.
- **Configuration Loss:** Accidental deletion or reinitialization of the RAID configuration metadata.
- **Failed Rebuild Attempts:** When IT staff attempt to rebuild or reconfigure the array incorrectly, the internal RAID structure can be overwritten, requiring direct low-level intervention.

## How We Recover Server Data at Dr. Hard Disk

We support Windows Server, Linux, NAS appliances (QNAP, Synology), and all major server platforms:

1. **No Modifications to Your Original Hardware:** Your servers remain untouched. We begin by disconnecting all disks and reading each one individually, creating a 100% identical mirror of every drive — quietly and without any write operations to the original media.
2. **Virtual RAID Assembly:** We do not need your original RAID controller. Our intelligent system rediscovers the array parameters (block size, parity order, disk order) and reconstructs the virtual RAID structure from scratch.
3. **Rebuild Failure Recovery:** If your IT team previously attempted a flawed rebuild or reconfiguration, we analyze the geometric distribution differences, repair the translation tables, and extract the data.
4. **Diagnostic Sample Delivery:** We extract databases or critical file samples for you to verify integrity before proceeding with the full recovery.
