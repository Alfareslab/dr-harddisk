External hard drives are the go-to companion for backups, work files, and personal media. However, their portable nature makes them the most vulnerable to accidental damage — from drops and unsafe ejections to cable failures and interface corruption.

At **Dr. Hard Disk**, we understand the value of your data and handle all common external drive problems: unrecognized devices, "You need to format" errors, accidental drops, and USB interface failures.

## Most Common External HDD Problems

These issues represent roughly 80% of the cases we receive:

1. **Device Not Recognized:**
   The computer detects that something is connected but cannot read any data, or Windows shuts down the USB port entirely to protect itself.
2. **Format Required Error:**
   The notorious message: `You need to format the disk in drive before you can use it`. **Never click "Format"** — doing so can significantly reduce the chances of successful recovery.
3. **USB Port or Cable Damage:**
   The integrated USB connector can break or short-circuit, requiring an interface bypass or direct SATA conversion to access the drive's PCB.
4. **Abnormal Sounds After a Drop:**
   Faint beeping or light clicking after an external drive has been dropped typically indicates head damage requiring a clean room intervention.

## Our External Drive Recovery Process

We handle all major brands professionally — WD Passport, Seagate Expansion, Toshiba Canvio, ADATA, and others:

- **Safe Initial Assessment:** We use specialized PC-3000 tools to evaluate the drive without applying any additional stress that could worsen the damage.
- **USB Interface Translation:** In modern drives (like WD My Passport), the USB connector is often soldered directly to the PCB. We perform a SATA conversion — bypassing the integrated interface to communicate directly with the drive's logic board.
- **Defensive Image Extraction:** We never copy-paste files directly. Instead, we create a full sector-by-sector image (Image Dump), then resolve logical errors on the copy, and finally extract the recovered data.
- For drop cases, we work inside a clean room to safely transfer the platters to a controlled environment and complete the recovery.
