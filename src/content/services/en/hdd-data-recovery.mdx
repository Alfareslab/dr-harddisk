Has your hard disk suddenly stopped working? Is it making unusual clicking or beeping noises? We understand the anxiety that comes with losing critical data — whether it is work files, databases, or irreplaceable personal memories. At **Dr. Hard Disk**, we rely on advanced tools and deep expertise to handle every type of hard drive failure.

## What Causes Hard Disk Drive (HDD) Failures?

Mechanical hard drives contain incredibly precise moving parts spinning at high speeds. The most common failures include:

1. **Physical Failures (Electrical and Mechanical):**
   - **Head Crash:** Typically caused by drops or physical impact, this is the primary reason behind the infamous clicking sound. The read/write heads make contact with the platter surface, causing severe damage.
   - **PCB Failure:** Power surges or sudden outages can burn critical components on the drive's circuit board, rendering it unresponsive.
   - **Motor Failure (Spindle Seizure):** The platters simply stop spinning, often due to bearing wear or electrical damage.
2. **Logical Failures (Software-Level Damage):**
   - Corrupted file system or damaged partition table.
   - Virus or malware interference, including ransomware encryption.
   - Accidental formatting or file deletion.

## How We Handle Damaged Hard Drives

We follow strict protocols to maximize recovery rates without putting your remaining data at risk:

- **Clean Room Environment:** Physical repairs — such as head swaps — are performed exclusively inside a Class 100 clean room to prevent dust contamination of the internal platters.
- **Precision Diagnostics:** Using advanced systems like *PC-3000*, we analyze the drive's response, map its condition, and identify the exact failure type before any intervention.
- **Donor Parts Library:** We maintain an extensive inventory of genuine replacement parts, allowing us to source matching read/write heads for your specific drive model quickly.
- **Defensive Imaging:** Rather than copying files directly, we create a sector-by-sector image of the drive in a non-destructive manner — even when bad sectors are present — preserving the original media untouched.

We work with all major hard drive manufacturers including *Western Digital*, *Seagate*, *Toshiba*, and others.
